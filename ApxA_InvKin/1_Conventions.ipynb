    "# Introduction\n",
    "As with any complex topic, it's important to maintain a consistent set of notations and conventions. These notes are taken from [\"Mobile Robotics - Mathematics, Models, & Methods\" by Alonzo Kelly](https://smile.amazon.com/Mobile-Robotics-Mathematics-Models-Methods/dp/110703115X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1545686416&sr=8-1&keywords=Mobile+Robotics+Alonzo+Kelly). That said, some of these conventions may be atypical of other groups, nonetheless the concepts shall remain the same."

    "# Notation Remarks\n",
    "There will be times when functions are referenced in an unspecified manner, for example $f(), g(),$ and $h()$. Sometimes we may refer to $f(t,/omega) = a \\cdot t + b + \\omega(t)$ in one paragraph, and $f(t,\\omega) = \\exp(\\jmath \\omega t)$ in another. Within the same paragraphs, you should expect to see subsequent references as $f()$; beware of context. Likewise, notice the first example of $f(t, \\omega)$ : the function specification did not note that $\\omega(t)$ was itself a function."

    "Tensor notation will also be used when describing physical quantities with relation to one another, that is to say a relationship $r$ between objects $a$ and $b$ will be noted as $r^a_b$. Some relationships are not transitive (e.g., transfer-cost between two nodes of a directed graph), thus $r^b_a \\ne r^a_b$. Do not think of these relationship quantities as some attribute of any of the noted objects, again using transfer-cost as an example, $r^b_a \\ne r^c_a$."

    "## Coordinate Systems & Frames of Reference\n",
    "Some relationships/quantities only have meaning in relation to another. For example, a velocity $v_a^b$ connotes the velocity vector of some object $a$ with a frame of reference $b$. What distinguishes frames of reference from one another is their *state of motion*."

    "# Embedded Coordinate Frames\n",
    "Virtually every component of the robot (sensors, motors, frame) are a machination of multiple reference frames -- for a sufficiently complex system, there will always be adaptation measurements and error to some other reference frame, and these correspond to transformations and noise between the reference frames. When we discuss these reference frames in context of just the single robotic system itself (that is, not in some other local/global frame), we call them **embedded coordiante frames**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some quantities can have their coordinate frames \"stripped\" and still have meaning. For example *velocity*: $\\overrightarrow{v}_a^c = \\overrightarrow{v}_a^b + \\overrightarrow{v}_b^c$. When the arrow-notation is used, that helps to express that the vector itself is *coordinate system independent*. This is important because **all physical laws hold irrespective of the coordinate system in which the relationships involved are expressed**. Conversely, when describing a vector whose relationship is with a single coordinate system ($a$), it will be noted as ${}^{a} \\underline{v}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bound & Free Transformations\n",
    "Because of these coordinate frames, we need to note transformations between them. Let's suppose there's a position vector $\\overrightarrow{r}_p^a$ of some point $p$ with respect to a coordinate frame $a$. We wish to transform this to coordinate frame $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *bound transformation* will move the \"tail\" of the vector into frame $b$ to produce the vector $\\overrightarrow{r}_p^b$. This is a transformation of the reference frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *free transformation* leaves the vector itself alone and expresses it in the coordinate frame of $b$; in this case, $\\overrightarrow{r}_p^a$ is **projected** onto $b$ as ${}^b \\underline{r}_p^a$ with the following formula:\n",

    "# Rigid Transformations\n",

It may not preserve distance between two points, but it preserves properties between the lines, like incidence angle, parallelism, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **homogeneous transformation** is an afine transformation without the explicit translation. In a sense, we're limited to only a linear multiplication, which allows the transformation to be treated as an *operation* on the points. We still wish to include translation, so we augment our coordinates to create **homogeneous coordinates**:\n",
