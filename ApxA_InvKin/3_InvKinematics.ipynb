    "# Introduction\n",
    "**Inverse Kinematics** is the process of knowing the end-point of the desired articulation and solving for the joint parameters. This is a fundamental problem in robotic control. This involves finding the solution to a set of nonlinear equations, and thus suffers from its perils: solutions may not exist and may not be unique. Think of it this way: an arm can only reach points within its **workspace** (so any point outside has no solution); and within the workspace, the elbow, wrist, and sholder can flex while your fingertips remain touching the same surface.\n",

    "Because of this, there are two methods to solve for $\\rho$: an **analytic technique** or an iterative **gradient-descent search**."

    "Solving through analysis is more mathematics intensive, involving a comprehensive understanding of both linear algebra and trigonometry. This is usually helpful in low DOF mechanisms. As the DOF rises, so too does the computational complexity of the solutions, and thus becomes more succeptible to computational error.\n",

    "In a sense, the final transformation is given (that is, solved first), so we need to solve for each intermediate articulation. This can be done (using DH convention) by pre- and post-multiplying the inverse transformations of the articulations to isolate specific unknowns. Consider the following relationships:\n",
