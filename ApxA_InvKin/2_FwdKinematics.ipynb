    "# Introduction\n",
    "**Forward Kinematics** is the process of chaining homogeneous transformations to represent articulations in mechanisms and/or fixed transformations between two frames (linear & rotatary). The process boils down to finding the appropriate chain of transformations given the joint & link parameters. In this case, we're solving for each $r' = T(\\rho)r$ where $\\rho$ represents the vector of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most mechanisms are *non-linear*, representing multiple rotary joints and thus **degrees of freedom**. Though this is the case, the chaining of transformations allows this to remain a linear transformation of *matrix valued function* of $\\rho$."

    "# Mechanism Models & Conventions\n",
    "A **mechanism** is considered as any collection of joints (linear or rotary) joined by links. As a general rule, we'd like to model a sequence of connecting joints as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assigning embedded frames to the links in sequence such that each frame moves into coincidence with the next as a function of the joint variable\n",
    "- Write *orthogonal operators* that corespond to these operations in *left-to-right* order\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example Articulation](images/ArticulationExample.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in robotics, we represent the product of the four transformational operations (*Rot(x)*, *Rot(y)*, *Rot(z)*, and *Trans(r)*) as a single computational unit; this is known as the **Denavit-Hartenberg** (DH) Convention. They can be used in place of the string of each set of orthogonal operators becasue they are orthogonal operators themselves (hence why a ball-joint is considered a single DOF even though it has rotations in two axes)."

They're also connected to links whose lengths $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$ (with the very end being a fixed claw-manipulator.
